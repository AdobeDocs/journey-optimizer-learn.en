# Create a lookup dataset

A Dataset Lookup allows Adobe Journey Optimizer to retrieve reference or transactional data from an Adobe Experience Platform dataset at journey runtime, without requiring that data to be stored on the real-time customer profile.

In this use case, when a user submits an Investment Preference form (Stocks, Bonds, or CDs), the journey dynamically looks up the corresponding investment details from a reference dataset and uses that information to personalize an email.
