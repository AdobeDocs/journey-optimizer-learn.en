# Deliver offers with the Decisions API

This video shows how to deliver [!DNL Offer Decisioning] offers with the Decisions API. Using [!DNL Postman] to demonstrate, an API call is made to retrieve the container id. Next, a sample Decisions API call is customized with the activity id, placement id, identity namespace, and customer id to retrieve a personalized offer. Once you've retrieved a personalized offer with the Decisions API, you can integrate the offer content with your marketing system.
