title: In-app messages - Overview
description: In-app messages are messages that appear inside an app while the user is actively using it. They are overlay-type messages that sit on top of your app. They don't pop up on the lock screen or outside the app â€” instead, they show up as banners, pop-ups, or small cards while the user is exploring the app.
