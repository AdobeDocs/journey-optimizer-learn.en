title: Content cards - Overview
description: Content Cards are persistent, in-app messages that live inside a dedicated inbox or feed within your app. Unlike push notifications, they don't interrupt the user and can be viewed at the user's convenience.  
They're ideal for delivering non-urgent, informative, or promotional content that benefits from visibility over time.
