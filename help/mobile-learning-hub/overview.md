## Mobile channels

Understand which mobile channels are available in Journey Optimizer and what they are used for.

+++Push notifications

**Push notifications** are short messages that pop up on a phone, tablet, or computer — even wheny the user is not using the app that sent them. They're a way for apps to "tap you on the shoulder" and get your attention.

For example:

* A shopping app might alert you to a big sale.
* A delivery app might let you know your order is on the way.
* An airline app might let you know that your flight is ready to check in.

**Important:** The user has to give the app permission (opt-in) before it can send you push notifications. This usually happens when the app is first opened after downloading it, or later if the app asks again during use. Without the user's permission, the app can't send push notifications to their device.

### Use Cases

Choose push notifications as your preferred messaging channel when you need to:

| # | Benefit | Why | Example Use Cases |
|---|---------|-----|-------------------|
| 1 | Reach users instantly, even if they're not in the app | Push messages can appear on the lock screen or as banners without requiring the user to open the app. | Urgent alerts (service outages, safety warnings), time-sensitive offers (flash sales), real-time updates (sports scores, order delivery). |
| 2 | Drive re-engagement | Push can bring inactive users back into the app by delivering personalized and relevant prompts. | Abandoned cart or browse reminders — e.g., "You left items in your cart — checkout now for 10% off." |
| 3 | Reduce dependency on costlier channels | Push is generally free to send once you've built the infrastructure, unlike SMS or email where there are per-message costs. | Use push instead of paid SMS for frequent updates. |
| 4 | Deliver rich, interactive content | Modern push APIs allow images, videos, quick actions (e.g., "Accept" / "Decline"), or deep links to specific app screens. | Marketing campaigns with visual appeal; quick user actions without fully opening the app. |
| 5 | Leverage device-native capabilities | Push notifications integrate with iOS/Android OS features like vibration, sounds, badges, and geofencing triggers. | Location-based offers when near a store; reminders triggered at specific times. |
| 6 | When opt-in is likely | Push only works for users who have explicitly opted in. If the app offers high value or the brand already has trust, opt-in rates can be strong. | Apps with loyal user bases; onboarding flows that explain the value of notifications. |

### When NOT to use push as the primary channel

* Low opt-in rates or user resistance to notifications.
* Need for long-form content (email may be better).
* Sensitive or highly private information (push can be seen on lock screens).
* Users are mostly on desktop and not in the mobile app.

+++In-app messages

In-app messages are messages that appear inside an app while the user is actively using it.
They don't pop up on the lock screen or outside the app — instead, they show up as banners, pop-ups, or small cards while the user is exploring the app.

For example:

A game might show a pop-up explaining a new feature the moment the user unlocks it.

A shopping app might display a banner with a coupon code while the user is browsing items.

A social media app might show a message suggesting the user follow new accounts.

In-App messages are great for guiding the user, showing special offers, or explaining how to use new features — but they only work if the user is already in the app at that moment.

In-app messages are notifications that can be sent to users within your app, guiding them to specific points of interest. These notifications can be used for different purposes, such as promoting new features, presenting special offers, or facilitating user onboarding. By leveraging In-app messages, you can effectively engage with your audience and steer them towards important aspects of your application.

+++Content Cards

Content cards are a new digital messaging feature in Adobe Journey Optimizer that delivers personalized and engaging content directly within mobile apps and websites. Unlike traditional push notifications, Content Cards integrate seamlessly into the user interface, offering persistent, non-intrusive updates that enhance user interaction and experience.

+++Code-Based experience

Journey Optimizer allows you to personalize and test the experiences you want to deliver to your customers across all your touchpoints like: web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, video consoles, TV connected devices, smart TVs, kiosks, ATMs, voice assistants, IoT devices, etc.

With the code-based experience capability, you can define inbound experiences using a simple and intuitive non-visual editor. It allows you to insert and edit specific elements at individual and more granular locations of your apps or web pages, no matter the type of applications you have - rather than applying modifications to an entire content.
