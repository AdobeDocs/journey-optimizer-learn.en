## Mobile channel overview

Journey Optimizer support both inbound and outbound mobile channels:

### Outbound channels

Outbound channels are used to **proactively deliver messages** to customers without requiring prior interaction. These are ideal for campaigns, promotions, and transactional communications.

|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Sent outside the app, push messages grab attention immediately. They're ideal for time-sensitive updates and encouraging users to return to your app.| Direct messages sent to users' mobile phones without needing the app. Great for urgent alerts, reminders, and rich media content like images or videos.| Conversational channel through a widely used messaging app, allowing personalized, two-way communication and interactive campaigns.|

> Outbound channels enforce **Custom Consent Policies** at message send time. If consent is not granted for a specific marketing action, the message is blocked from delivery.

### Inbound channels

Inbound channels are designed for **customer-initiated interactions**, enabling personalized experiences when users engage with your brand.

|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Delivered while users are actively using your app, these messages are real-time and interactive. They're perfect for engaging customers in the moment.| Non-intrusive, persistent messages users can access anytime within the app. Content cards work well for sharing ongoing offers or helpful information.|Custom-coded messages enable highly personalized and dynamic campaigns, integrating real-time data and complex customer journeys.|

> Inbound channels support **real-time personalization** and **data capture**, such as landing page forms that feed into Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) for segmentation and targeting.

### How can mobile channels work together

By combining these channels, you can create a seamless and effective customer experience:

1. Use **push notifications** to quickly grab attention and bring users back to your app (e.g., "Sale starts now!").

2. Once inside, deliver **in-app messages** with personalized promotions (e.g., "Here's your 15% discount for today's sale").

3. Offer **content cards** so users can revisit the promotion anytime before it expires (e.g., "Your 15% discount ends Friday").

4. Use **SMS/MMS/RCS** to send timely reminders or rich media offers directly to users who may not be in the app.

5. Engage customers in meaningful conversations through **WhatsApp**, ideal for customer support or interactive campaigns.

6. Leverage **code-based experiences** to tailor every message based on user behavior and preferences, creating a truly personalized journey across channels.
