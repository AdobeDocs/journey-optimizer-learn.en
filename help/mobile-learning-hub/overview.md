| Sent outside the app, push messages grab attention immediately. They're ideal for time-sensitive updates and encouraging users to return to your app.| Delivered while users are actively using your app, these messages are real-time and interactive. They're perfect for engaging customers in the moment.| Non-intrusive, persistent messages users can access anytime within the app. Content cards work well for sharing ongoing offers or helpful information.|

### How can mobile channels work together

By combining these channels, you can create a seamless and effective customer experience:

1. Use **push notifications** to quickly grab attention and bring users back to your app (e.g., "Sale starts now!").

2. Once inside, deliver **in-app messages** with personalized promotions (e.g., "Here's your 15% discount for today's sale").

3. Offer **content cards** so users can revisit the promotion anytime before it expires (e.g., "Your 15% discount ends Friday").

4. Use **SMS/MMS/RCS** to send timely reminders or rich media offers directly to users who may not be in the app.

5. Engage customers in meaningful conversations through **WhatsApp**, ideal for customer support or interactive campaigns.

6. Leverage **code-based experiences** to tailor every message based on user behavior and preferences, creating a truly personalized journey across channels.
