# Use case description

In modern customer experiences, it's critical to unify user identities across devices and channels. This use case demonstrates how to implement identity stitching in Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) by linking a known CRM ID—captured during user login—with the anonymous Experience Cloud ID (ECID) generated by the Adobe Web SDK. By stitching these identities together in real time, AEP can build a more complete customer profile that spans both anonymous behavior and authenticated data. This enables more accurate audience segmentation, personalization, and decisioning within tools like Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO).
