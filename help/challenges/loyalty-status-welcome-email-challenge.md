Luma, a fictional athletic apparel company, is looking to promote its latest apparel and gear collection and to drive sales for existing customers. The Luma marketing team asks you to implement a summer collection marketing campaign and additional use cases that improve the customer experience and increase retention.

3. Send an email when a loyalty customer moves to a new tier to congratulate and inform them of their new benefits
4. When a previously out-of-stock item is back in stock, notify customers who had favorited the out-of-stock item with a call to start shopping now that the item is back in stock
