# Create and personalize messages

## The Story

Luma, a fictional athletic apparel company, is looking to promote its latest apparel and gear collection and to drive sales to existing customers. To support the new collection campaign, the Luma marketing team asks you to create two email messages that will be sent to customers as part of the Campaign.

## Your Challenge

Create the following emails in Journey Optimizer

### Email Message #1 – Summer collection announcement

Create an email to announce the arrival of the new Summer collection. 

1. You have received an html file from an agency with the design for the email body: [SeasonalCollectionEmail.html](/help/challenges/assets/SeasonalCollectionEmail.html)
2. Create an email message titled *(your name)_Luma – New Seasonal Collection*
3. Give the email a subject line: *(recipient’s first name), the new Luma collection is here!*
4. Use the provided HTML file for the email body  

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**

1. Preview the email using the Identity namespace: Email and the Identity value: **Jenna_Palmer9530@emailsim.io**
   * The subject line should read: Jenna, the new Luma collection is here!
2.	Send a proof to yourself:
  *	Enter your email address
  Select the test profile: **Jenna Palmer, Jenna_Palmer9530@emailsim.io**

You should receive an email. The subject line should read “Jenna, the new Luma collection is here!” and the email body should match what you have seen in the preview.

+++**CHECK YOUR WORK**

The email body should match the “Luma – New Seasonal Collection” message provided in the training environment, and any personalization fields should be populated as expected:

+++


### Email Message #2 – Order confirmation transactional email

#### Step 1: Create an order confirmation email to be sent when a Luma customer completes an online order

Create a new email message titled “(your name)_Luma – Order confirmation”. The subject line must be personalized with the recipients’ first name and must include the phrase “thank you for your purchase”

Following the Luma brand guideline the email should be structured as follows:

Luma logo 
*	Luma_Logo.png
* Size 35%, centered white background 
* It should have a link to the luma website: https://publish1034.adobedemo.com/content/luma/us/en.html
