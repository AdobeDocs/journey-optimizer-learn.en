## Understand the Workshop Use Case

You are a mobile marketer who works for the Vegas Stay resort in Las Vegas. You know that some big events like the NCAA Sweet 16 Tournament, the Taylor Swift concert and, biggest of all, Adobe Summit are all happening the same week in March! You want to capitalize on this as much as possible, so **you have a goal to increase the number of hotel room bookings made through your mobile app**.

To achieve this goal, you decided to create a multi-channel marketing strategy that includes in-app, push, SMS, and email messaging campaigns.  And, not surprisingly, you decide to use the best product out there, **Adobe Journey Optimizer**!

The in-app campaign allows you to target the users while they are using the Vegas Stay app. You create attractive banners and pop-ups that are displayed while the users are browsing the app. These banners highlight special deals and discounts on hotel rooms and include a clear call to action to book a room.

You design a single Push notification campaign. You want to create a simple yet effective Push notification to pull users into the app who have not yet booked a room. You want to create a message letting everyone know about the exciting events coming to Las Vegas, and draw users to the app.

To give the guest a great brand experience, you create a multi-channel journey. The journey is triggered upon the guest's arrival at the resort. You utilize push and SMS to welcome the guest to the resort and direct them into the app, for online check-in. Once they are checked in, the guest receives an email confirmation with a voucher for one of the hotel amenities and additional offers with things to do during their stay.

With this multi-channel approach, you are able to reach a wider audience, increase the number of hotel room bookings made through the app while also streamlining your efforts using AJO.

In the end, your efforts were a great success, and the company saw a significant increase in revenue as a result!
