# Lesson 4 – Create a content experiment

*Your challenge:* You have several approaches for the push message in mind but are not sure which one will be most efficient. You want to make sure the most effective message is sent. 

*The Solution:* Content experiments allow you to optimize content for the actions in your journey. Through content experimentation, you can expose a given variation of a message to a group of randomly selected users and another variation/treatment to a different set of randomly selected users. After sending the message, you can then measure the outcome metrics you are interested in.

In this lesson, you will apply content experimentation to the push message.
