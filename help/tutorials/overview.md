# Journey Optimizer Tutorials- Overview

Journey Optimizer helps companies deliver connected, contextual, and personalized experiences to their customers. The customer journey is the entire process of a customerâ€™s interactions with the brand, from the first moment of contact until the customer leaves. It starts with the awareness phase, where the customer learns about the brand and starts engaging. The customer will then further interact with the brand, visit online and physical sites, and make purchases, send messages or post reviews.

This user guide contains videos and tutorials on the many features and capabilities of Adobe Journey Optimizer.
