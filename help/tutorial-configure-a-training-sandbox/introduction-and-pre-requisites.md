# Configure a training sandbox - Introduction and pre-requisites

This tutorial is designed for administrators and data engineers who are tasked with providing an Adobe Journey Optimizer training environment. It walks you through all the steps required to configure the schemas, ingest sample data and create events.

The provided sample data is based on a fictional athletic apparel company called Luma. Luma has stores in multiple countries, an online presence with a website, and mobile apps. Luma uses Adobe Journey Optimizer to deliver connected, contextual, and personalized experiences to their customers.

At the end of this tutorial, you will have a sandbox that supports the Luma use cases covered in the hands-on exercises in the [Journey Optimizer Challenges](/help/challenges/introduction-and-pre-requisites.md) section.

## Prerequisites

Before you can begin to set up your training sandbox, you must make sure that you have:

1. [Administrator rights](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer-learn/tutorials/access-control/access-management.html?lang=en)
   * To your organization's Journey Optimizer instance
   * **Journey Administrator** and **Data Manager** right for the training sandbox.
2. Dedicated Sandbox
    Create a development [sandbox](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer-learn/tutorials/access-control/create-and-manage-sandboxes.html?lang=en) which is used for training and exercise purposes only.
3. [Email Message presets](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer-learn/tutorials/channel-configuration/set-up-email-channel.html?lang=en) for marketing and transactional messaging.
4. Your organization's ID

   >[!TIP]
   >
   > **Where can I find my organization ID?**
   >
   > Navigate to [Adobe Experience Cloud Home](https://experience.adobe.com/. Once you log in, your Organization's ID is visible in your URL, it should look something like:
   >
   > `https://experience.adobe.com/#/@**your_organization's_id**/home`
   >

5. Download the required data:

   1. Download the [[!DNL luma-data.zip file]](/help/tutorial-configure-a-training-sandbox/assets/luma-data.zip) file, which contains all files required for this tutorial.
   2. From your downloads folder, move the `luma-data.zip` file to the desired location on your computer, and unzip it.
   3. There should be three JSON files:
      * luma-crm.json
      * luma-loyalty.json
      * luma-products.json
      These files hold the sample data that you will use to populate your sandbox with.
   4. Open each of the files and find and replace `yourOrganizationID` with your organizationâ€™s ID and save the files.

## What to Expect

This tutorial walks you through the required [data set-up](/help/tutorial-configure-a-training-sandbox/manual-data-set-up.md) and guides you through [setting up events](/help/tutorial-configure-a-training-sandbox/configure-events.md).

During the data set-up, you configure the required identity namespaces, create, and configure five schemas and the datasets for these schemas, as well as upload the dummy data.

The event set-up section walks you trough setting up the three events that are required for the hands-on exercises in the [Journey Optimizer Challenges](/help/challenges/introduction-and-pre-requisites.md).
