# Lesson 4 – Create a content experiment

*Your challenge:* You have several approaches for the push message in mind but are not sure which one is most efficient. You want to make sure the most effective message is sent. 

*The Solution:* Content experiments enable you to optimize your content for specific actions in your journey. By using content experiments, you can present one version of a message to a group of randomly selected users and a different version to another group. After sending the messages, you can then measure the outcome metrics that interest you.

In this lesson, you apply content experimentation to the push message.
