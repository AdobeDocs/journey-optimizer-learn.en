user-guide-title: Use decisioning to personalize web offers
user-guide-description: In this tutorial, you learn how to capture user preferences through a web form, send that data to Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) in real time, and dynamically qualify users into targeted audiences based on their selections. By combining Adobe Tags (Launch), the AEP Web SDK (Alloy.js), and Edge Segmentation, you enable immediate personalization opportunities for customers interested in Stocks, Bonds, or Certificates of Deposit (CDs).
