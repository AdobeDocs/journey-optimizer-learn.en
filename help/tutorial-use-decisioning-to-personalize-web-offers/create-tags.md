# Create tags to associate with offer items

To create tags with offer items in Adobe Experience Platform (AEP), you first need to create the tags themselves within the AEP Tag Management system. Then, you can assign these tags to specific offer items in the AEP Decisioning tool. 

1. Log in to Journey Optimizer.
1. Click **Administration** > **Tags** > **Create tag category**.
1. Give a meaningful name and description to the tag category.
1. Create tags in the newly created category.

For the purpose of this tutorial, the _FinWise Finance Offers_ tag category was created and a tag called _AssetPreference_ was created.
