# In-app messages

## What are in-app messages?

In-app messages appear inside your mobile app while a user is actively engaged. These overlay-style messages display as banners, pop-ups, or cards directly on top of the app interface. They do not appear on the lock screen or outside the app environment.

In-app messages are triggered by specific user actions or conditions — such as viewing a particular screen, completing a purchase, or qualifying for a targeted audience segment.


Examples include:

* A game showing a pop-up introducing a new feature the moment the user unlocks it.
* A shopping app displaying a banner with a coupon code while the user browses products.
* A social app suggesting new accounts to follow based on current activity

## When *not* to use in-app communication

* **User is not actively using the app**  
  In-app messages won't be seen if the user isn't currently logged in or engaging with your product. Use email or push instead.
* **Critical or time-sensitive issues requiring immediate attention**  
  For urgent messages (e.g., security alerts, payment failures), use channels that can reach the user outside the app, like SMS or email.
* **Regulatory or legal communications**  
  Compliance-related messages (e.g., terms updates, policy changes) may require delivery and read confirmation — better suited to email.
* **Account reactivation or win-back campaigns**  
  If the user is inactive or churned, they won't see in-app messages. Use re-engagement campaigns via email or push notifications.
* **High-volume transactional updates**  
  Notifications like shipping updates or receipts are often better sent via email for archival and convenience.
* **Overuse leads to banner blindness or annoyance**  
  Bombarding users with too many in-app messages can hurt UX and lead to frustration or ignored messages.
* **No connectivity / offline scenarios**  
  In-app relies on the user being online and in-session — it won't help in offline-first environments.
