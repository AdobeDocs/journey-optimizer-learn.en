## What is it?

**Content Cards** are persistent, in-app messages messages displayed within a dedicated inbox or feed inside your app. Unlike push notifications, they do not interrupt the user and can be viewed whenever the user chooses.

They are ideal for **non-urgent**, **informative**, or **promotional content** that benefits from longer visibility and repeated exposure. Think of Content Cards as an in-app "message center" or personalized content feed where users can browse updates at their own pace."

### Examples:

- A bank might show a new credit card offer inside your account dashboard.  
- A fitness app might surface new workouts or challenges in a feed.  
- A retail app might display personalized recommendations or promotions.

**Important:** Content Cards are silent, persistent, and don't require OS-level permissions.

## Use Cases

## When *not* to use content cards

Not every message belongs in a card. Avoid this channel when urgency or external reach is key.

- **Time-sensitive alerts** — use push or email for urgency (e.g., downtime, safety, payment issues). 
- **Inactive users** — cards only work when users are *inside* the app.
- **Sensitive or secure info** — use secure email or in-app modals for privacy-critical communication.
- **Urgent CTAs** — if it needs immediate action (e.g., flash sale expiring in 1 hour), cards are too passive.
