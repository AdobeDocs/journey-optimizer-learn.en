# Push notifications overview

## What what are push notifications?

**Push notifications** are short messages that pop up on a phone, tablet, or computer — even when the user is not using the app that sent them. They're a way for apps to "tap you on the shoulder" and get your attention.

For example:

* A shopping app might alert you to a big sale.
* A delivery app might let you know your order is on the way.
* An airline app might let you know that your flight is ready to check in.

**Important:** The user has to give the app permission (opt-in) before it can send you push notifications. This usually happens when the app is first opened after downloading it, or later if the app asks again during use. Without the user's permission, the app can't send push notifications to their device.

## Use Cases

Choose push notifications as your preferred messaging channel when you need to:

| # | Benefit | Why | Example Use Cases |
|---|---------|-----|-------------------|
| 1 | Time-sensitive updates| Push messages can appear on the lock screen or as banners without requiring the user to open the app. |  <ul><li> Urgent alerts (service outages, safety warnings)</li><li>Time-sensitive offers (flash sales)</li><li> Real-time updates (sports scores, order delivery)</ul> |
| 2 | Re-engagement | Push can bring inactive users back into the app by delivering personalized and relevant prompts. | <ul><li> Abandoned cart or browse reminders — e.g., "You left items in your cart — checkout now for 10% off."</li></ul> |
| 3 | Reduce dependency on costlier channels | Push is generally free to send once you've built the infrastructure, unlike SMS or email where there are per-message costs. |<ul><li> Use push instead of paid SMS for frequent updates.</li></ul>|
| 4 | Deliver rich, interactive content | Modern push APIs allow images, videos, quick actions (e.g., "Accept" / "Decline"), or deep links to specific app screens. | <ul><li>Marketing campaigns with visual appeal</li><li>Quick user actions without fully opening the app.</li></ul> |
| 5 | Leverage device-native capabilities | Push notifications integrate with iOS/Android OS features like vibration, sounds, badges, and geofencing triggers. | <ul><li> Location-based offers when near a store</li><li> Reminders triggered at specific times.</li></ul> |
| 6 | When opt-in is likely | Push only works for users who have explicitly opted in. If the app offers high value or the brand already has trust, opt-in rates can be strong. |<ul><li> Apps with loyal user bases</li><li> Onboarding flows that explain the value of notifications.</li></ul> |

## When NOT to use push as the primary channel

* Low opt-in rates or user resistance to notifications.
* Need for long-form content (email may be better).
* Sensitive or highly private information (push can be seen on lock screens).
* Users are mostly on desktop and not in the mobile app.
