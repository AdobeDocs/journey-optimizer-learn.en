# SMS/MMS/RCS - Overview

## What is it

**SMS (Short Message Service)**, **MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service)**, and **RCS (Rich Communication Services)** are mobile messaging channels that let you reach users directly on their phone number — without requiring an app or internet connection (SMS/MMS).

* SMS: Plain text messages up to 160 characters.
* MMS: Messages with media (images, video, audio) or longer text.
* RCS: Modern evolution of SMS with features like read receipts, rich media, carousels, and branded sender profiles. (Support varies by device and carrier.)

These channels are device-native, high-visibility, and widely accessible. They're ideal when immediacy, reach, or guaranteed delivery matters.

Examples:

* A bank sends a fraud alert via SMS.  
* A retailer shares a coupon image through MMS.  
* A travel company sends a boarding pass using RCS with quick reply buttons.

**Important:** SMS/MMS/RCS require explicit user opt-in for compliance with privacy and carrier regulations (e.g., TCPA, GDPR).

### When not to use SMS/MMS/RCS

Use these channels with care — they can be powerful but also costly and potentially intrusive.

* When cost is a concern — SMS/MMS can incur per-message fees, especially at scale.
* For long-form or complex content — Email or in-app is better for detailed explanations or structured layouts.
* When you don't have user opt-in — Sending without permission can lead to legal consequences and user distrust.
