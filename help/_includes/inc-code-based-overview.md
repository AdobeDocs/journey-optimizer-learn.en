# Code-Based experience - Overview

## What is it

Code-based experiences allow you to deliver personalized, dynamic content and messaging using custom code — such as JavaScript, APIs, or templating languages — within Adobe Journey Optimizer.

This channel is ideal for building highly tailored, data-driven interactions that extend beyond standard visual authoring tools (WYSIWYG editors), giving developers and optimization managers full flexibility to design custom personalization logic and content layouts.

Examples:

* Customizing email or push notification content based on complex user attributes or behavior.
* Integrating third-party APIs to fetch real-time data and inject it into messages.
* Building advanced decision logic or multi-step campaigns triggered by specific events.

**Important:** Requires developer skills and testing to ensure correct data handling and delivery.

## Use cases

Choose code-based experiences when you need to:

| # | Benefit | Why | Example use cases |
|---|---------|-----|-------------------|
| 1 | Deep personalization | Enables highly tailored messaging using complex logic and real-time data | <ul><li>Dynamic product recommendations based on recent browsing</li><li>Personalized discounts calculated from user loyalty status</li></ul> |
| 2 | Integrate external systems | Fetch and display external data directly in communications | <ul><li>Weather-based promotions</li><li>Real-time inventory updates in email</li></ul> |
| 3 | Create advanced workflows | Build multi-step, conditional journeys that adapt per user actions | <ul><li>Abandoned cart follow-ups with timed reminders</li><li>Reactivation campaigns triggered after inactivity thresholds</li></ul> |
| 4 | Go beyond platform limits | Add features or messaging formats not supported out-of-the-box | <ul><li>Custom interactive email elements</li><li>Complex SMS message variations</li></ul> |
| 5 | Improve campaign flexibility | Quickly adjust logic or content without waiting for platform updates | <ul><li>Seasonal content toggles</li><li>Real-time error handling in journeys</li></ul> |

## When not to use code-based experiences

* When you need quick, simple campaigns that can be built with no-code tools.
* If you don't have access to developer resources or testing environments.
* When timeline or budget constraints limit custom development.
* For standard messaging that fits well with built-in platform features.
* When maintainability is a concern — custom code requires ongoing support.
