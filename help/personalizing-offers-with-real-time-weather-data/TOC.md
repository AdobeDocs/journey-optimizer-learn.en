user-guide-title: Personalizing Offers with Real-Time Weather Data in Adobe Journey Optimizer using Web SDK
user-guide-description: This tutorial demonstrates how to personalize web content based on real-time weather conditions. When a user visits the website, their current location is used to retrieve live weather data such as temperature and conditions (e.g., rain, clear skies). This contextual information is sent to Adobe Experience Platform using the Web SDK (alloy), allowing Adobe Journey Optimizer to evaluate and return targeted offers—such as seasonal promotions or weather-appropriate product suggestions—that are automatically rendered on the page.
