# Create Offer 

An Offer Item in AJO represents a single piece of personalized content—such as a promotion, message, or recommendation—that is delivered to a user based on decisioning logic.

When you create an Offer Item in AJO, it must be based on a Decisioning Schema, which defines the structure and fields available in the offer—such as title, description, imageURL, offerText, etc.

This schema:

*   Standardizes the content model for all offers in a collection.

*   Allows consistent personalization fields across offer items.

*   Enables selection strategies to match rules to structured content


## Modify the schema

*   Log in to Journey Optimizer
*   Decisioning -> Catalogs -> Edit schema
*   Add an element of type string called offerItem as shown below 

    ![decisioning-schema](assets/offer-schema.png)

## Create offer item

*   Decisioning -> Catalogs -> Create item

*   Create three offers: "Love Stocks", "Love Bonds", and "Love CD". For each offer, copy and paste the corresponding offer text provided at the end of this article into the appropriate offer item.



*   Tag the offers with the tag created in the previous step.

*   Approve the offers

*   Completed offer with standard and custom attributes defined
