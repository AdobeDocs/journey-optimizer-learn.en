## Use the decision policy in the code editor

From the personalization editor,click on Insert policy.The code corresponding to the decision policy is added.

At this stage, you can include any required decision attributes directly within the code. These attributes are defined in the schema used by the Offers catalog. Standard attributes are organized under the __experience namespace, while any custom attributes specific to your organization are stored under the `_<imsOrg>` namespace.

This code goes through a list of personalized offers chosen for the user and displays the text for each one on the web page. It shows the message (called offerText) from each offer inside a paragraph, so users can see their tailored content clearly.
If no personalized offer is available, a fallback offerâ€”is shown to ensure the space isn't left blank.
