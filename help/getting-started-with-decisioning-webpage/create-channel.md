# Create a Code based experience channel

A Code-Based Experience in Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO) Decisioning is a configuration that enables the delivery of personalized offers directly into a web page using client-side JavaScript. Instead of relying on predefined templates or visual layout tools, this approach gives developers full control over when and where offers are rendered using the Adobe Web SDK (Alloy.js).
