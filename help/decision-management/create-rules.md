# Create decision rules

Learn how to create [decision rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/offer-decisioniong/create-components/creating-decision-rules.html) for decision management. Rules or "decision rules" are one of the required building block components of personalized offers. Rules are built using the events and attributes in Platform's Real-time Customer Profile and from the eligibility constraints of offers. For example, a rule could be used to restrict an offer for snow shovels to customers who live in regions where it snows.
